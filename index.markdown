### Who am I?

I am currently working as a postdoc at the Carl von Ossietzky Universit채t Oldenburg, in the project Morphology Materializing, funded by the DFG. The PIs of the project are Kristian Berg (Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg) and Stefan Hartmann (Heinrich Heine University D체sseldorf).

From 2014 to 2024, I worked at the Heinrich-Heine-Universit채t D체sseldorf. First, I was a visiting fellow in the [SToRE](http://www.sfb991.uni-duesseldorf.de/en/store-graduate-training-program/) program. After that, I contributed as a postdoc to the project [A02](http://www.sfb991.uni-duesseldorf.de/en/a02/) from the CRC 991, before being part of the [TreeGraSP](https://treegrasp.phil.hhu.de/) ERC project, led by Laura Kallmeyer. 

From 2010 to 2014, I was a Ph.D. student at the [LIFO](http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/), in the [CA](http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/Members/duchier/equipe/pmwiki/pmwiki.php) (Constraints & Machine Learning) team, under the supervision of [Denys Duchier](http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/Members/duchier/) and co-supervision of [Yannick Parmentier](http://sourcesup.cru.fr/tulipa/yannick/).

### What do I do?

### Research:

My main research interests are Natural Language Processing and Constraint Solving. I am the main developer of [XMG-2](https://user.phil.hhu.de/petitjean/research/xmg-2/), a grammar engineering tool which is related to both of these interests. The aim of XMG is to let linguists build large scale precision grammars, independently from the level of linguistic description or of the formalism used to describe it.

I also contribute to the development of the latest release of the parser TuLiPA, called [TuLiPA-frames](https://github.com/spetitjean/TuLiPA-frames).

### Teaching:

I taught various courses in computer science and computational linguistics. The list is available on the [teaching page.](https://user.phil.hhu.de/petitjean/teaching/)

### Code:

I like to program using different languages. Most of my recent projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/spetitjean) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/simon_petitjean).
