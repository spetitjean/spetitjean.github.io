## Course description:

This course provides an introduction to the Tree-Adjoining Grammar (TAG) formalism, with a particular focus on Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammar (LTAG). It also introduces the notions of grammar engineering and parsing in the context of TAG, using tools such as XMG and TuLiPA. Throughout the course, we will highlight the importance of TAG and related formalisms in computational linguistics by providing syntactic and semantic analyses of a range of linguistic phenomena, and by exploring implementations that demonstrate the formalismâ€™s adequacy for natural language analysis.
